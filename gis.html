			<h3>Projects</h3>
			<h4>Tree Canopy Optimization in the City of Peterborough</h4>
			<p>Completed a project with a focus on supporting the City of Peterborough’s objective of increasing urban canopy cover to 35% by 2050. Worked extensively with LiDAR point cloud data to assess tree canopy height and distribution, conducted spatial analysis to identify priority areas for canopy growth, and created detailed maps to visualize findings. Utilized ArcGIS platforms to perform geospatial processing, develop interactive dashboards, and communicate results effectively to stakeholders. Gained hands-on experience in applying GIS tools and data visualization techniques to support urban forestry planning and environmental sustainability goals.</p>
